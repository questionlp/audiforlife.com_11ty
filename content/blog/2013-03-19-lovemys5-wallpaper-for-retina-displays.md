After a recent Saturday morning visit to [PDX C&C](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/)</a>, I decided to do a second photo shoot of my Audi S5 with spacers installed. This time, there was a bit of an overcast and it had been drizzling a little bit, leaving nice raindrops on the car.

Once I got home and started processing the photos that were taken, one really stood out and was just begging to be made into a wallpaper. So, I decided to make two different versions of a wallpaper that are optimized for both an iPad with Retina Display and a 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. The latter can be used on computers with widescreen displays, but will either be scaled down or cropped.

To download the full-size wallpapers, right-click the image below and choose "Save Link As". If you click on "Save Image As" or "Save Picture As", you will only get the thumbnail version.
