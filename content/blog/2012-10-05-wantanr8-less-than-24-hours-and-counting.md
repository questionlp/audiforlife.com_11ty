Saturday morning, Audi will have a film crew come out and interview me while I am at PDX C&C and will have the R8 delivered. I will be getting the keys at around 10:00 and I will depart PDX C&C for a nice drive. The film crew will be there to record the drive for about 3-4 hours; after which, I will get to enjoy the car for the remaining 32 hours.

The experience will come to an end on Sunday at around 16:00, which is when I will have to return the keys. That will be a sad moment :(

I will try to capture some of my drive sans film crew with my own GoPro and will try to find spots to take photos of my drives and of the R8.
