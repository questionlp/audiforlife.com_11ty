Back on June 24th, [Audi Expo 2017](http://www.audiexpo.com/) was held at [Griot's Garage Flagship Retail Store & Event Center](https://www.griotsgarage.com/) in Tacoma, Washington, and I made the trek up there to cover the event for the sixth straight year. You really couldn't have asked for better weather and great selection of modern era Audis.

My trip up to Audi Expo from Portland was the first long-ish trip that I made in my [Audi exclusive Ara Blue A4 allroad](/2017/03/farewell-lovemys5-hello-lovemyallroad/); which, thanks to Ben at [Audi Seattle](http://www.audiseattle.com/), I have dubbed it, "[araroad](https://twitter.com/hashtag/araroad?src=hash)". I also brought with me, my go-to camera bodies (Nikon D800E and D500) and a set of lenses that covered the ultra-wide angle to telephoto range: AF-S 24-70mm f/2.8 and Sigma 12-24mm f/4 Art full-frame lenses for the D800E and a Sigma 50-100mm f/1.8 Art for the D500.

The following are some of my favorite photos from the event; which, I grouped by generation or vintage. Additional photos have been uploaded to the "[Audi Expo 2017](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157682486331942/)" album on Flickr.

Everyone who comes to Audi Expo gets a chance to vote for their favorite car and a chance to win door prizes. The ballots are collected and tallied up towards the end of the event and the Audi with the most votes wins the Best in Show award. This year, the gorgeous blue Audi S2, owned by Dimitri of [German Autohaus](http://thegermanautohaus.com/) in Woodinville, Washington, snagged the top prize.

Audi Expo couldn't happen without the fine sponsors: [Griot's Garage](https://www.griotsgarage.com/), [Audi Tacoma](http://www.auditacoma.com/), [Audi Seattle](http://www.audiseattle.com/), [Audi Bellingham](http://www.audibellingham.com/), [Audi Club of North America](https://audiclubna.org/) and the [Audi Club Northwest](http://www.audiclubnw.org/) chapter, [Addict Motorsport Design](https://www.fastaudi.com/), [Queen City Auto Rebuild](http://queencityautorebuild.com/), [German Autohaus](http://thegermanautohaus.com/), [Avants](https://www.avants.com/), [DirtFish Rally School](http://www.dirtfish.com/), [APC Auto Spa](http://www.advancedprotectivecoatings.com/) and [Wold Farmer's Insurance Agency](https://agents.farmers.com/wa/university-place/richard-wold).

As always, I had a great time meeting people, seeing the variety of mods and the many hours of love and labor put into making each Audi unique, and getting to cover the event. I look forward to seeing and going to next year's Audi Expo.
