March 13th, the day that my 2011 Audi S5 coupé draped in Sprint Blue got its 15 minutes of fame when Edmunds [InsideLine.com](http://www.insideline.com) posted my Readers Rides [story about my baby](http://audiforlife.com/lovemys5/). That posting caught the eye of Audi USA and tweeted twice about it:

You would be correct in that the activity on my two Twitter accounts went ballastic for a bit. Over time, the buzz faded and it looked like its 15 minutes were up.

Well, I hate to say it, but I was wrong. Yesterday, [Audi USA](http://www.audiusa.com) [posted something](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150614623431470.377492.96585976469&type=3) on their [Facebook Timeline](https://www.facebook.com/audi):

For some reason, I didn't see it until [Scott Mitchell](http://iamaudi.com) and [Audizine.com](http://www.audizine.com)</a> tagged me in their posts ([1](https://www.facebook.com/ScottAlexanderMitchell/posts/156906854432523), [2](https://www.facebook.com/audizine/posts/327159354012089)):

I guess there is still a wee bit of buzz surround my #LoveMyS5! ;)
