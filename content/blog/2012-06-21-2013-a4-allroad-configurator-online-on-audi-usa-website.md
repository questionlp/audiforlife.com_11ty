For those that are interested in building and pricing out a 2013 A4 allroad quattro, the [online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=A4-H-2013) is now live on the [Audi USA](http://audiusa.com/) website. Right now, the configurator currently shows images of the Euro-spec allroad versus the US-spec allroad. You can also toy with the full body paint option to see if it is to your liking.

The way that I would love to build and order an A4 allroad quattro would be to start with the Prestige trim in Glacier White and black leather. For packages and options, I would tick off the Sport Interior package and Layered Oak Wood Inlays. Including the $895 destination charge, the shebang clocks in at $51,520. Below is what it would look like:

Have fun with the online configurator!
