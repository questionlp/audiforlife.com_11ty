I have created another desktop wallpaper from a photo that I took at [Audi Wilsonville's](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) allroad Event from 30 March 2012. As with the [first allroad wallpaper](http://audiforlife.com/2012/07/a4-allroad-quattro-desktop-wallpaper/) that I posted from the same event, this one is another black and white photo.

The desktop wallpaper is available in three different sizes: 1440x900, 1680x1050 and 1920x1200. To download a wallpaper, just right-click on any of the sizes and choose "Save Link As...".
