It has been over a year in the making, starting back in Summer 2014, when Sunset Audi broke ground and [started the construction of their new Terminal building](http://www.audibeaverton.com/blog/2014/june/26/sunset-audi-terminal-building-construction-updates.htm). This past Thursday night, they celebrated not only the grand opening of the new Terminal, but also their new name to fit the new Audi dealer naming nomenclature: [Audi Beaverton](http://www.audibeaverton.com/).

As part of the grand opening celebration event, Audi Beaverton brought in food and catering, which featured food by Portland chef (and Top Chef contestant) [Gregory Gourdet](https://gregorygourdet.com/), wines and spirits, a red carpet photo experience, a DJ to spin tunes, and showcased some cars.

Of course, the most important car that Audi Beaverton had at the event was the brand new 2017 Audi R8 V10 plus coupé ([the same R8 that I got to take photos of a couple days before the event](/2015/09/in-photos-dynamite-red-2017-audi-r8-v10-plus/)). The R8 was under a cloak for the first hour of the event, with its LED DRL barely peering through the black cloak.

Parked on the other side of the stage and speaker podium was a gorgeous Audi Sport Quattro coupé that is owned by a local [Audi Club Northwest](http://www.audiclubnw.org/) member.

Another local Audi Club Northwest member's Audi, a beastly APR supercharged Audi S5 coupé, was also featured just outside the Service Center parking bay.

Right before the new R8 was unveiled, the emcee of the event brought up Rob Roseta, VP of Audi Beaverton, and Mark Del Rosso, EVP and COO of Audi of America to build up to the unveiling of the new R8. I had the opportunity to have a quick chat with Mark afterwards.

This gave the opportunity for everyone to get an up close look and experience of the new R8.

Audi of America also presented Audi Beaverton a sculpture commemorating the opening of the new Terminal.

In addition to the new R8, Audi Beaverton also had Timber Joey, Jack Jewsbury and Darlington Nagbe of the [Portland Timbers](http://www.timbers.com) (Audi Beaverton is the official luxury car sponsor of the Portland Timbers). Even though I had a chance to meet and say hello to Jack and Darlington at a Timbers season ticket holder event a few weeks ago, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to say hello to them again. Unfortunately, I didn't not get a clean photo of either of them due to people swarming them. Outside of the new Terminal building, Audi Beaverton had a number of other Audis from their inventory on display, including a beautiful Ibis White RS 7 and a Sepang Blue S5 coupé.

A little bit later, the emcee brought the guests's attentions to Rob Roseta and Karen Feiner, who spoke on the 35 years that Sunset Audi / Audi Beaverton has served the area and thanked everyone who came to the event. They also [showed a video projected on one of the curved walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WycubZS2ek), which ended with the new Audi Beaverton name and the Audi logo.
