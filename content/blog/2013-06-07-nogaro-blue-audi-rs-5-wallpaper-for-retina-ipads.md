Just about a week ago, I had the opportunity to do a [photo shoot of an Audi Exclusive Nogaro Blue Audi RS 5 coupe](http://flic.kr/s/aHsjFH4oDb) that had just arrived at [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/).

Out of all of the photos, there was one that I absolutely fell in love with. And, as with all other photos that steal my heart, it immediately became the wallpaper for my iPad and one of my laptops. After getting a really positive feedback from teasing a screenshot of the iPad lock screen with the photo, I have worked out a version to share with everyone.

Huge thanks to the guys at Audi Wilsonville for letting me do the photo shoot and for helping out to stage the car.
