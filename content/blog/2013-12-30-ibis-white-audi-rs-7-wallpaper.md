Ever since I posted a screenshot of my iPhone and iPad with a photo of an Ibis White RS 7 that I took at [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/):

I have gotten a number of requests for a version of the photo for use as a wallpaper. I went back and tweaked the photo to make it a bit more usable as a wallpaper for smartphones, tablets and widescreen displays. The photo below has been optimized for use on a desktop or laptop with a widescreen.

The following photo has been optimized for use on an iPad Retina and non-widescreen displays. It can also be used on smartphones using the phone's selective cropping.
