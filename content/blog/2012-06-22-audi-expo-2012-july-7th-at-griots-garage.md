Calling all Audi owners and fans in the Pacific Northwest! [Audi Expo 2012](http://www.audiexpo.com/) is being held on July 7th at [Griot's Garage Flagship Retail Store](http://www.griotsgarage.com/) in Tacoma, WA. It all starts at 4:00 PM and will wrap up around 9:00 PM.

Along with the live music, food, beer and wine garden, tech classes and meeting up with other Audi owners and fans, the brand new S6, S7 and an e-tron will make an appearance.

If you are interested in attending, please make sure that you RSVP on the [Audi Expo](http://www.audiexpo.com/) website. Also, if you are on Facebook, please feel free to join the [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/415270688518284/) that I have setup on my page.
