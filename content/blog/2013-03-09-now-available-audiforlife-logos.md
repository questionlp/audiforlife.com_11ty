The #AudiForLife hashtag has been around a while now and I have decided to make a logo out of it. The logo is based on the Audi For Life logo, with the hash symbol replacing the red Audi Sport slash. The logo was created using Adobe Illustrator and the [Orbitron](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Orbitron) font. Since there isn't an oblique variant of the font, I had to mimic it using the Shear function.

I have created six variants of the logo, each based on the three common colors for Audi: black, white and red.

The files are in PNG format and can be used as badges or watermarks for your photos. I am making all six logos available under the Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.
