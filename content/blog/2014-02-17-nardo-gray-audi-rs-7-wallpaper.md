Last Monday, I published a set of photos taken from a [photo shoot of a Nardo Gray Audi RS 7](/2014/02/photo-shoot-nardo-gray-audi-rs-7/) at [Audi Wilsonville](http://audiwilsonville.com/). One of the photos that I have been working on from the shoot seemed to make for a pretty good looking wallpaper; so, I decided to make two versions of the photo optimized for widescreen displays.

The 1920x1080 version has been optimized for the most common widescreen display ration 16:9; while, the 2880x1800 version is perfect for those on 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina Displays.
