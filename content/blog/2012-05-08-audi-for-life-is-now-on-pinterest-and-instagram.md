Although I have been slow to jump on-board the social media train, I have been working on expanding Audi For Life's online presence. Recently, I have joined the Instagram train (@AudiForLife) when the Android app was released. If you don't have access to the iOS or Android Instragram, you can view my Instagram feed by way of Extragram: [extragram.com/audiforlife](http://extragr.am/audiforlife).

Starting yesterday, Audi For Life is also on Pinterest. You can view my pins at [pinterest.com/audiforlife](http://pinterest.com/audiforlife/).

Where will Audi For Life expand to next? Keep an eye out on this blog.
