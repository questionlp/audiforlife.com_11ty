**Note:** This article has been refreshed based on the latest news from Audi of America's [2013 MY Prices and Release Dates](/2012/07/2013-my-prices-and-release-dates/) press release.

If you currently look at the engines that Audi has been using across the various non-RS and R8 models in the US over the past couple of years, you will see that it there is everything from the venerable 2.0 TFSI, 2.0 TDI, 3.2 FSI V6, 3.0 TFSI supercharged V6, 3.0 TDI, 4.2 FSI V8 and the ginormous 6.0-liter and 6.3-liter W12. The 3.2-liter V6 had been available in the A4, A5, Q5 and A6; but for the 2012 models, it can only be found in the high-end Q5 trims.

Starting with the 2013 model year, the number of engine options will be slimmed down for non-RS and R8 models sold in the US and will have displacements of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 liters and will all have some form of forced-induction.

Starting with the 2.0-liter engines, both the 2.0 TFSI petrol and 2.0 TDI diesel turbo inline-four engines will continue to make up all of the sales of the A3, TT, A4 (including the new allroad quattro) and A5; with only the A3 seeing both petrol and diesel engines and the other models will only see the petrol version. The Q5 and A6 will also see the 2.0 TFSI engines in both standard and in hybrid configurations. At this time, it is not known whether the US will see the 2.0 TDI engine in future A4 or A5 models.

The 3.0 TFSI supercharged V6 petrol engine will continue to expand its presence in various Audi models for the 2013 model year. The engine can already be found in the 2012 S4, S5 cabriolet, A6 and Q7. Starting in 2013, the engine will replace the 4.2-liter V8 in the S5 coupé and in the A8 and will find itself in the top-trim Q5.

The 3.0 TDI diesel engine, currently only found in the Q7, will also be found in the A8 L for 2013. The power output has been bumped by 15 HP for a total of 240 HP in the 2013 Q7. The same engine will eventually make it into the Q5 as a 2013.5 or 2014 model. It is very possible that the US will see the same engine be used in the A6 and the A8 (short wheelbase), but that is pure speculation. There are no plans on bringing over the bi-turbo version of the 3.0 TDI as that would require the addition of an AdBlue system to meet EPA requirements.

Odd one out, the top-of-the-line A8 L W12 will still have a displacement of 6.3-liters.

For 2013, the US will see the new biturbo 4.0-liter V8 in the new S6, S7 and S8 models. In the S6 and S7, the new V8 will make 420 HP and 406 lb-ft of torque. That horsepower figure is eerily similar to the output of the quattro Gmbh 4.2-liter V8 found in the upcoming RS 5 and R8 4.2. There is a very good chance that we will see the new biturbo replace the 4.2-liter engine in said models in the near future. In the S8, the biturbo V8 will make 520 HP and 479 lb-ft of torque. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar to the output of the 5.2-liter V10 found in the R8 5.2? I would say that the R8 will definitely get the new engine either with the redesign or rework.

For the 2013 RS models, they will each get their own specific engines with the 4.2-liter V8 in the RS 5 coupé and 2.5 TFSI in the TT RS.
