The updated 2013 Q5 crossover will make its splash in the United States with three different drivetrain options: the current 2.0 TFSI petrol engine, the ubiquitous supercharged 3.0-liter V6 replacing the 3.2-liter V6, and a 2.0 TFSI hybrid.

Unfortunately, the much bandied-about 3.0 TDI will not make it across the Atlantic until the 2014 model year [as reported](http://blog.caranddriver.com/confirmed-audi-q5-to-add-3-0-liter-v-6-diesel-model-for-2014/) by [Austin Lindberg](http://www.caranddriver.com/search/all/author/Austin+Lindberg) of [Car and Driver](http://blog.caranddriver.com). The 3.0 TDI, which is also found in the larger Q7, will put out 245 HP and 428 lb-ft of torques. The even more impressive SQ5 TDI (which makes 313 HP and 479 of torques) will also not be brought over to the US, at least in its current form or we may see a petrol version instead.
