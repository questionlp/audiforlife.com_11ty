The folks at [QuattroWorld](http://www.quattroworld.com/)</a> have published the [2013 Audi USA Order Guide](http://www.quattroworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Audi_2013_Order_Guide.pdf) and provided a [summary](http://www.quattroworld.com/2013-model-year/breaking-audi-reveals-2013-model-changes/) of what the new model year brings. Unfortunately, the order guide does not include the 2013 Q5 or the lovely R8. The suspense of what drivetrain options will be available for the Q5 and the R8 will have to wait for another day.

In this blog post, I will cover the new S and RS models, along with changes to the existing S models and touch on the new 2013 A4 Avant-based allroad quattro. I will also briefly touch on significant changes to other models.

There is an interesting note listed for the 2013 A6 2.0TFSI with quattro: "4G25MA - NOT AVAILABLE FOR ORDERING". Don't ask me what that means, because I am not sure what it means either.

## S6 and S7

Both the S6 and the S7 share the same platform and drivetrain configuration; in this case, you'll find the new biturbo 4.0-liter V8 that is making its way throughout the VW/Audi family (debuting in the Bentley Continental GT V8). In this particular configuration, the biturbo V8 will provide 414 BHP and 410 foot pounds of torques and is mated to an S-Tronic dual-clutch gearbox and the standard quattro with Sports Rear Differential. Neither are available with a manual gearbox. In either case, you will have a "V8T" badge adorning the front fenders.

The LED headlights, made famous by the Audi [#SoLongVampires Super Bowl advert](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw9ZeXB2uKs), are optional on both the S6 and the S7. Also optional is a black cloth headliner option, various inlay options (fine-grained Ash natural inlays are standard, while brushed Aluminium, Carbon Atlas and layered Oak inlays can be ordered). The main components of Audi Drive Select are standard, as is MMI Navigation plus with MMI touch.

Interestingly listed under standard features is "Energy recovery system without stop-start". As far as standard wheels and tires, you would be looking at 19-inch five dual-spoke S design wheels with 255/40 summer tires. You have the option to jump up to 20-inch five dual-spoke Star design wheels with 265/35 summer tires.

Paint options include the usual Ibis White, Brilliant Black, Glacier White, Ice Silver, Quartz Gray, Oolong Gray, Havanna Black, Moonlight Blue and Phantom Black. New is Estoril Blue with crystal effect.

## S8

The S8 returns with the 2013 model year after a brief hiatus and is now equipped with the same biturbo 4.0-liter V8 that powers the S6 and S7. Unlike the S6 and S7, the biturbo V8 spools up 520 BHP and sends power through a Tiptronic gearbox. quattro with Sports Rear Differential is standard, along with S8 specific air suspension and adornments. Carbon Atlas is the standard inlay available for the standard trims and for the shifter trim. Leather trim for the shifter is available.

Paint options are limited to Phantom Black, Havanna Black, Daytona Gray, Prism Silver Crystal and Glacier White.

## RS 5

The RS 5 will also get the S-Tronic dual-clutch gearbox and quattro with Sports Rear Differential standard (again, no manual gearbox); but, instead of the new biturbo V8, the RS 5 will still get the same high-revving 4.2-liter V8 from the RS 4 and the R8 (albeit with some tweaks and tuning changes). Listed under standard features is the 174 MPH top speed limiter.

Unlike the current TT RS, the RS 5's standard wheels will be 19-inch 10-spoke forged wheels wearing 265/35 summer tires. The 20-inch 5-arm Rotor design wheels wearing 275/30 summer tires are optional; though, it is included if you opt for the Titanium package. If you like carbon fiber inlays, you're in luck as RS 5-specific Carbon Atlas comes standard; with, Aluminium Race inlays available as an option. By the way, you'll have to live with a tire sealant and repair kit as no space saving tire is available.

Since the Sports Rear Differential is standard for the RS 5, you can complete the Audi Drive Select package by adding the Driver Assist package that includes the dynamic steering component. Also available as an option are ceramic front brakes, sports exhaust system with black finishers, and Audi MMI Navigation plus package. Fine Nappa leather seats are standard, but you can also opt for a monotone black Leather with Alcantara inserts S Sport seats.

Paint options include Phantom Black, Panther Black Crystal Effect, Daytona Gray, Ibis White, Prism Silver Crystal Effect, Misano Red and Sepang Blue (I'll take Sepang Blue, thanks!).

## S5 coupé, S5 cabriolet and S4

For those of you that have been yearning for the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 to finally appear in the S5 coupe, y'all will be happy! For the rest of us, _sigh_. Yep, the 2013 S5 coupe loses the smooth 4.2-liter V8 that we have all loved and gains the more efficient and low-end torque happy force-inducted V6. With the new engine, the S5 also gets to drop the rather antiquated six-speed Tiptronic for the S-Tronic seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox that is found in it's relatives: the S4 and S5 cabriolet (along with the S5 sportback that is only available outside of the US). Don't worry, the six-speed manual gearbox is still available for the S4 and the S5 coupé and still not available for the S5 cabriolet.

As with earlier model years, the standard seats in the S5 coupé continue to be leather with Alcantara inserts. Unlike for the 2012 model year, two-tone seats with Alcantara are back in the form of black with silver inserts! Unfortunately, the iconic Sprint Blue paint is **not** coming back. Instead, Misano Red, Volcano Red and Estoril Blue Crystal Effect paints are now available for both the S5 coupe and S4. The rest of this section apply for both the 2013 S4 and S5 models.

As with the outgoing models, quattro with Sports Rear Differential is still optional. Unlike the outgoing models, you will not be able to order the Audi Drive Select package as a single package anymore. Instead, the adaptive damping suspension component of Audi Drive Select is now standalone and requires either the Sports Rear Differential or the Drive Assist package (which includes the other ADS component, dynamic steering). You should be able to order the dynamic suspension with both option packages; but, for those that want the dynamic steering, you will now be forced to get it with adaptive cruise control (with stop and go). Speaking of steering, 3-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel is now the standard wheel.

The 2013 S5 coupé and cabriolet see a wheel and tire size drop to 18-inch five-parallel spoke S design wheels with 245/40 summer tires (which matches the standard kit for the 2013 S4), the 19-inch five-segment spoke design wheels with 255/35 summer tires are optional for both the S4 and S5.

You will be able to order the S5 coupé and cabriolet, and the S4, in Premium Plus and Prestige trims. The big changes for 2013 is that the MMI Navigation plus includes Audi Connect and that the Audi Side Assist is only available in the Prestige package. The rear acoustic parking sensors are now gone; but, the rear backup camera is still available and is only available with the MMI Navigation plus package.

Still not available in the S5 coupé is a sliding panel sunroof, it is still just a tilting panel.

## A4 and A5

Many of the packages and options changes for the S4 and S5 models are also replicated to the A5. Of course, the A5 does not get any S model specific options or features, including the Sports Rear Differential. Paint options for the 2013 A5 have changed a bit, including: Teak Brown lovers will have to say good-bye to the paint option, fans of blue will rejoice as Scuba Blue is available, and Cuvée Silver is available.

## allroad quattro

Come late-Summer, the new allroad quattro will arrive in the US with US spec options and features. The new allroad quattro is based on the outgoing A4 Avant (_sniff_) in more ways than one: the new allroad quattro will be available in the same trim levels (Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige) and has the same turbo 2.0-liter engine mated with the 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox.

If you want the MMI Navigation plus package with Audi connect, you will have to start with a Premium Plus trim and add it as an option or skip directly to the Prestige trim where it is included. There are no suspension options available for the allroad, only the allroad specific suspension (sorry, no adaptive air suspension or ride height control). If you want something sportier, you are limited to the Sports Interior package (not available in Premium trim) with the sportier seats and 3-spoke steering wheels with shift paddles. You can bump up from the standard 18-inch 5-arm Rotor design wheels with 245/45 all-season tires to a set of 19-inch five-arm Structure design wheels and 245/40 summer tires; as with the Sports Interior package, the upgraded wheels and tires are not available in Premium trim.

Audi Drive Select controls, which are included in the Driver Assist package (only available in Prestige trim), only provide options for the included dynamic steering and engine/gearbox settings. As with the S4 and S5, the rear acoustic parking sensors are now gone; but, the rear backup camera is still available and is only available with the MMI Navigation plus package.

Don't like the allroad quattro cladding? You can get the full paint finish option, but only if you choose Ice Silver, Glacier White or Phantom Black paint. The allroad quattro comes standard with Aluminium Trigon inlays, with dark brown Walnut, fine-grained Ash natural and layered Oak inlays available for order. Scuba Blue has been added to the available paint options for the A4 sedan and allroad quattro.

## A8

The S5 coupe isn't the only model to see its 4.2-liter V8 engine be taken away for the 2013 model year. The standard wheelbase A8 will get the same supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that has been proliferating through the models and will be rated about the same as the one found in the S4 and S5. Along with the new engine, a start/stop system with energy recovery is now standard. The A8 L W12 seems to miss out on the start/stop hotness.

quattro with Rear Sports Differential is now available as a standalone option (not available in the A8 L W12), rather than being tied to a specific Audi Drive Select plus package; but, it does require upgrading to 20-inch ten-parallel spoke design wheels with 265/40 R20 summer tires or the Sport Design package.

## Q7 TDI

The Q7 TDI gets a minor bump in horsepower (up 15 BHP to 240 HP) compared to the outgoing 2012 model year. It is unknown what change(s) have allowed for this bump in power, but my gut feeling is that the ECU has been tweaked. Torque numbers have not been released yet.
