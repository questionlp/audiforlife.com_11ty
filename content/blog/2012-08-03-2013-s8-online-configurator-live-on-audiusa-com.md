Audi of America has posted up both the [2013 S8 page](http://models.audiusa.com/s8-sedan) and the [online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=S8-2013) on AudiUSA.com. The new 2013 S8 has a bi-turbo 4.0-liter V8 that produces 520 HP at 6,000 RPM and 481 torques at 5,500 RPM that is all sent to an eight-speed Tiptronic transmission with quattro.

The starting list price for the new 2013 S8 is $110,000 (or $110,895 with the destination charge). Checking many of the boxes cranks the price easily past $132,000.
