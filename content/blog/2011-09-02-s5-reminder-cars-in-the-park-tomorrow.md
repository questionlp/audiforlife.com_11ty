Just another reminder for folks in the Portland metro area that I will have my 2011 S5 on display at the [Cars in the Park](http://specialexhibitions.portlandartmuseum.org/allure/events/carsinthepark93/)</a> event tomorrow. The theme for tomorrow is "2 Seaters at the Meters" and there will be several other Audi vehicles representing the [Audi ClubÂ Northwest](http://www.audiclubnw.org/). The event is free for all, so come on down and check out the cars on display (mine as well).

Also remember that the Cars in the Park event is just one of the many events that is part of the larger [Allure of the Automobile](http://specialexhibitions.portlandartmuseum.org/allure/) exhibition at the Portland Art Museum. Please note, that entrance to the Allure of the Automobile does require admission.
