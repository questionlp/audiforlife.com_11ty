Monday, 23 April 2012, marks two significant milestones for me. Two years ago, on 23 April 2010, I filled out the order form for and the deposit down on my [#LoveMyS5](/lovemys5). That was the day that sealed the fate of how the S5 would be built on the assembly line and what it would look like when I would pick it up after four months of waiting.

The second milestone? I will turn 2^5 (or 0x20 or 0b100000) years old. Yep, I took my birthday off to start the ordering process for my S5 :)
