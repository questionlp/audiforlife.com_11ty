On 24 March 2012, [Sunset Audi (now Audi Beaverton)](http://www.audibeaverton.com) in Beaverton, Oregon hosted an A4 allroad quattro unveiling event. While waiting for the unveiling of the Euro-spec A4 allroad quattro, I walked around the showroom and part of the outside lot. Right in front of the showroom, there was a nice, black R8 5.2 Spyder sitting there just begging to be photographed. So, I took out my Leica M9 with a Summicron-M 50mm f/2 and took several photos.

After leaving the event and started rummaging through the photos, there was a particular photo of that R8 that stood out:

Okay, so my 2011 S5 was caught in the frame; but, I just love how the R8 Spyder looks from the rear. Sure, you don't get to see the engine. On the other hand, the tonneau cover for the folding top with the vents, the mesh grille vent in the spoiler and the soft top's flying buttresses make it one of the best looking convertibles and Spyders.

Anyway, I have finally decided to turn that photo into a desktop wallpaper for all of you to enjoy. Below are both 16:9 and 16:10 versions of the wallpaper. To download any of them, just right-click on the version you want and choose "Save Link As..."
