In the previous two posts in the "Analysis of the 2013 Model Year Pricing" series, I have covered the pricing the whole line up of A4/A6/A8 sedans, A3 and A7 Sportbacks, A5/S5/RS 5 coupés and A5/S5 cabriolets. In this third part in the series, I will be covering the Q7 and the TT models.

Also, I will tease everyone with the Audi exclusive options available for the new S6 and S7. Unfortunately, pricing still hasn't been released for the Q5 crossover, R8 supercar or the new S6, S7 and S8 (including the aformentioned Audi exclusive options).

As with the previous two posts, all prices listed are retail pricing.

Starting with the 2013 Q7 3.0 TFSI, the base Premium model now starts at $46,800, or $550 more than the 2012 model. For the 2013 Q7 3.0 TDI, the base Premium model also sees a $550 bump from the 2012 model to $52,000. To upgrade from the Premium to the Premium Plus level, expect to pay an additional $6,350; which, is $50 more than for the 2012 model. If you plan to add the MMI Navigation plus option to the Premium level (it is standard with Premium Plus), it will cost you $2,850.

Both the 2013 Q7 3.0 TFSI S line Prestige and the Q7 3.0 TDI Prestige also sees a minor price bump of $600 for 2013; which, brings the 3.0 TFSI from $59,950 to $60,550 and the 3.0TDI from $63,950 to $64,550. If you want to add the base S line package to the Q7 3.0TDI, the cost is still set to $2,000. Adding the S line plus package on top of that will be an extra $1,200. Both prices have not changed since the 2012 models. Ticking the adaptive air suspension option will still cost an extra $2,600.

For all Q7 models and trims, a Rear Seat Entertainment system is available starting late summer for $1,950.

If you are looking for a 2013 TT, a TTS or a TT RS coupé, the base models sees a $350 price increase from last year's model from $38,300 to $38,650 for the TT Premium Plus, $47,000 to $47,350 for the TTS Premium Plus, and $56,850 to $57,200 for the TT RS.

The 2013 TT and TTS roadsters, both will also see a $350 price increase over the 2012 models, with the TT roadster going from $41,300 to $41,650 and the TTS roadster going from an even $50,000 to $50,350.

Moving up to Prestige for either the TT coupé or the roadster is still a $6,100 checkbox and a $3,300 checkbox for either the TTS coupé or the roadster. All other option and package pricing has not changed with the new model year.

The 2013 TT RS also sees two Audi exclusive Bi-Color Interior options in either Fine Nappa leather interior with Black / Crimson Red or Black / Titanium. Either option will cost $3,000.

If you plan on ordering an S6 or S7, there are several Audi exclusive options available at this time. First, choosing any of the following will incur an Audi exclusive order (option code "AEO") is $1,200. There are two Audi exclusive Valcona Leather packages available, Audi exclusive Leather controls for the steering wheel and gear shift, Audi exclusive wood inlays and Audi exclusive floor mats. At this time, no pricing has been released for any of those options.
