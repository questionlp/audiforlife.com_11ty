As part of my trip over to the Washington, DC area last week, I went to the "[Cars, Cars & Cars](https://www.facebook.com/events/215269325286017/)" event, presented by [Rockville Audi](http://www.rockville-audi.com/) and hosted at the [Bretton Woods Recreation Center](https://www.bwrc.org/) in Maryland. Although this wasn't the first time the event was held, first one was held last October, but it was the first one that I had been able to go to. Both events have been planned and executed by Julie McCoy, or as I affectionately call her "the Queen of #WantAnR8" and Rockville Audi.

Rockville Audi had brought out several Audis to the event, including a 2014 Audi R8 V10 Spyder, an Audi S6 and an A8 L 3.0 TDI. Their Porsche store had also brought out a Cayenne and the new Cayman.

Also at "Cars, Cars & Cars" was Andrew Elliott of Audi USA and two members of [HUGE](http://hugeinc.com), Audi's social media agency, Zev Kanter and Ross Hollebon. I actually got to meet all three and Julie, for the first time, the night before at Audi HQ in Herndon, VA and we had gone out for some food and drinks.

Also at the event was a catered breakfast featuring bacon, bacon and more bacon. I think the smell and taste of bacon matches extremely well with the smell of petrol, revving of engines and the sights of dozens upon dozens of beautiful cars.

The photos were taken with a Leica M9 and a Voigtl√§nder Nokton Classic 35mm f/1.4.

I want to thank Julie McCoy and Rockville Audi for helping make this event possible and a huge success.
