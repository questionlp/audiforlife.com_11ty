One series of video reviews that I watched over and over while trying to decide whether I should get the Audi S5 was the one [OnCars](http://www.oncars.com/) did on the 2009 Audi S5. The series comprised of three videos, each focusing on one aspect of the S5, and a "director's cut" or B-roll. I have included the videos in the order in which they should be viewed.
