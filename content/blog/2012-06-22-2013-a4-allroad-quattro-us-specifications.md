In my blog post [comparing the new 2013 A4 allroad quattro and the 2012 Q5](/2012/04/in-depth-comparison-2013-a4-allroad-quattro-vs-2013-q5/), I had included several dimension estimates for headroom, legroom and cargo volume. I ran across a [PDF](https://pictures.dealer.com/aoa/f35b7c7a0a0d02b7002f996f54d66dc0.pdf) (warning, the file is about 15MB) containing some of the specifications for the US-spec allroad. The specifications can also be found in the allroad [Detailed Specification page](http://models.audiusa.com/allroad/detailed-specifications)Â on the Audi USA site. Below is a summary of those specifications:
