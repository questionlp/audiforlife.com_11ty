As mentioned in the "[Weekend Notes: Audi Q5 2.0 TFSI](/2013/11/weekend-notes-audi-q5-2-0tfsi/)" post, I had the opportunity to be one of two club photographers for [Audi Club Northwest's](http://www.audiclubnw.org/) Quattrofest 2013 at Portland International Raceway (PIR). Quattrofest 2013 was held on the weekend of November 2nd and 3rd. This year's Quattofest was dedicated in the memory of Bruce Fields, who has been a significant part of the Audi community and the club.

I nearly filled out the rear cargo area of the Q5 with several bags of camera and photography equipment, including three cameras, eight or so lenses, an Induro carbon fiber monopod, a Gitzo carbon fiber tripod, a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead with quick-release clamp and gobs of batteries, memory cards and filters. For the cameras, I brought my entire arsenal of a Nikon D300, a Leica M9 and a Sony RX100 compact camera.

Most of the photos were taken with the Nikon D300, which had any one of the following lenses mounted throughout the weekend: a 35mm f/1.8G DX, a 105mm f/2.8G VR macro, a 70-200mm f/2.8 VR II and a Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8. The Leica M9 spent most of its time with a Voigtländer 21mm f/4 mounted on it for close up, glamor shots.

It was great meeting a lot of the club members that I've chatted online in various forums or groups, seeing those that I've met the year before and those that I haven't met before. Seeing (and hearing) a wide ranging set of cars, including some non-Audis, also made this petrol head smile hour after hour.

The weekend also has its low points, which included an outright downpour (in which I was out taking photos with a rain jacket on myself and on my camera), dealing with a faulty memory card reader (thus losing about 250 shots).

Below is a sampling of the various cars that took part of Quattrofest 2013 and a few photos from the banquet held the night of November 2nd. The entire set of photos taken by yours truly can be found on Flickr within the "[2-3 Nov 2013 Quattrofest 2013](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157637313397864/)" album. The photos taken by the other club photographer, Chris Mitchell, can also on Flickr in his album, "[Audi Quattrofest 2013](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismitchellphotography/sets/72157637331769105/)".

I would like to thank [Audi Club Northwest](http://www.audiclubnw.org/) for providing both Chris Mitchell and myself the opportunity to be photographers for the event.
