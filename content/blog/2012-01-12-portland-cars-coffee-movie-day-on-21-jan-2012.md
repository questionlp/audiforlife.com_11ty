The last several weeks at [Portland Cars & Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cars-Coffee-Portland/200707606718?sk=wall) has had a rather lackluster turn out of Audi owners, and I would like to see that change! Next Saturday, 21 Jan 2012, will be a quick get together at the usual meeting place and will be followed by a caravan and viewing of the original "Italian Job".

For those without access to Facebook, below is information that was posted:

> **WHAT:** Portland Cars & Coffee Special Event - A Showing of the original "Italian Job" movie
>
> **WHEN:** Saturday, January 21, 2012 at 9:30 a.m.
>
> **WHERE:** Intel Hawthorn Farms Campus Auditorium:
> 5200 NE Elam Young Pkwy. Bldg. HF3, Hillsboro, OR. 97124
>
> Feel free to come directly to the Intel HF3 lobby and auditorium OR meet at the Portland Cars & Coffee location at 8:30 a.m. to caravan over. The address to join the caravan is 15350 SW Sequoia Pkwy in Tigard just off the I5. The group meets in the parking lot behind the Starbucks. Come join your fellow car enthusiasts. Those interested will go to McMenamins Imbrie Hall after for the movie for lunch.

Please pass this on to all of your Audi, Volkswagen or any other car enthusiasts that you know!
