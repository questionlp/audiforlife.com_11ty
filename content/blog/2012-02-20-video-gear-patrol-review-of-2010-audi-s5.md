Back when I was waiting for my 2011 Audi S5 to be produced and shipped over, I spent untold number of hours looking at various pictures and reviews of the Audi S5. One of those reviews was done by [Gear Patrol](http://www.gearpatrol.com/) and featured an S5 wearing Sprint Blue and Black/Silver Alcantara seats. The S5 reviewed was fully loaded with the Prestige package, Audi Drive Select, 19" five tri-spoke wheels and Side Assist.
