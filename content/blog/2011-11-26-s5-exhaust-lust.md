When Audi introduced the A5 and S5 coup√©s, I became smitten with love when it came to the styling inside and out. Love was replaced with lust the moment I drove an S5, mostly when I heard the sound of the 4.2-liter V8 (the drive and feel of rowing my own gears helped too). The level of lust got high enough that I ended up purchasing one.

Ever since I have owned it, I have wanted to be able to hear the exhaust from inside the car a bit more. For a while, I had considered getting a Stasis Signature [Challenge Exhaust](http://stasisengineering.com/products/exhaust/exhaust-s5-42-challenge-2008). I even had the opportunity to sit in an S5 with the exhaust installed, albeit in an S5 with Tiptronic. I loved the sound of the exhaust during acceleration and engine breaking; but, the droning from idle to about 3500 RPM was extremely wearing. I opted not to go with that exhaust as I couldn't live with it.

Now, both [Stasis](http://stasisengineering.com/products/exhaust/exhaust-s5-42-touring-2008) and [AWE](http://www.awe-tuning.com/products/audi-1/s5/4-2-v8/awe-s5exhaust.html) have Touring versions of their exhaust systems that are designed to negate much of the maligned droning. With the availability of both systems have caused my lust for a more pronounced, yet livable, exhaust is ratcheting up. Pricing for both systems is within a couple of hundred of each other (excluding installation), but it is still a decent amount of money.

With that said, has anyone with an S5 with a manual transmission have either Touring exhaust system installed? How would you describe the sound and droning levels from idle to about 3000 RPM? An inquiring mind wants to know.
