It was another gorgeous Saturday morning for [PDX C&C](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/) and the great weather also brought out six Audi RS cars, three B7 RS 4 sedans and three TT RS coupés.

Each of the RS 4 sedans wore different colours: Suzuka Gray, Avus Silver and Daytona Gray. Of the three TT RS coupés, there were two in Ibis White and one dressed in Audi Exclusive Aviator Gray.

Later in the morning, the three Audi TT RS coupés lined up next to each other, with the two Ibis White TT RS coupés sandwiching the Audi Exclusive Aviator Gray TT RS.
