I had a wonderful opportunity to do a photo shoot of a bespoken Nardo Gray Audi RS 7 Sportback, with the Matte Aluminium Optic Package with "quattro" script, at [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/). It was the first RS 7 with the "quattro" script that I have seen in person; plus, it was the first time that I got to sit and ride in an RS 7. Hearing the sound of the RS 7 start up under the service driveway made my heart skip a few beats.

The only thing that made the photo shoot a bit difficult was that the temperature was hanging around 22-25F and there was a bit of wind blowing. Gloves helped to keep my hands from freezing up; but, they did get in the way a bit too much when trying to swap lenses and filters. Still, I think I was able to get a good number of photos.
