It all started with [Audi](http://twitter.com/audi) [tweeting the following](https://twitter.com/Audi/status/205653537097646081):

Well, that lead to the gears in my head to start turning, causing them to flake off a lot of rust and to squeak quite mightily, and I just had to respond with something. I started looking for the right picture of a BMW M5 (which saw it's 4.2 seconds 0-60 MPH number crushed by the 2013 S6's [3.7 seconds run by Car & Driver](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-audi-s6-test-review)) and started fiddling around with it.

It had to be high quality photo and it had to be blue (my favourite colour, what can I say). I also wanted to pay homage to the above picture with the quad BMW roundels and used the same base caption. Once I located the right photo, I started the painful process (painful to me as I don't do a lot of photo manipulations) of tweaking it in [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/). If I had a bit more time to think massage the photo, I would have changed the caption colour to match that of the Audi red.

After some amount of time passed, I replied to Audi with the [following tweet](https://twitter.com/AudiForLife/status/205678886997082112):

By the way, "one" was a typo and should have been "on". I also [posted the picture](https://www.facebook.com/audiforlife/posts/359168660804742) on to [Audi's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/audi) (which got a pretty good reaction). Well, a bit of time passed and I headed out to grab some food. When I got back and brought up Tweetdeck, I was stunned to see Audi's [tweet](https://twitter.com/Audi/status/205729416486199297) (with the picture I tweeted) and the slew of responses:

> We asked, you delivered: [http://twitpic.com/9os6ok](http://t.co/63GwNlLs) Thanks, **[@AudiForLife](https://twitter.com/AudiForLife)**! **[#thingsslowerthananS6](https://twitter.com/search/%23thingsslowerthananS6)**

All of this happened just about a week after the [Hello Kitty #WantAnR8 tweet](https://twitter.com/AudiForLife/status/203537763914620929). It has been an interesting week on Twitter, that's for sure!
