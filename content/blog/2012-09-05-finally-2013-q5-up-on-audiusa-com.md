It has been some time in the making, but the 2013 Q5 [model page](http://models.audiusa.com/q5)</a> and [online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=Q5-2013) has finally been posted on to AudiUSA.com.

The 2013 Q5 brings along not only a nice looking facelift, but also several new drivetrain combinations and the deprecation of the 3.2-liter V6. In place of the aging 3.2-liter V6, the Q5 gets a version of the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that can be found in everything from the A6, A7, A8, Q7, S4 and S5. There is also a Q5 2.0T hybrid with quattro in the cards, though only available in the Prestige trim. Still holding the entry level is the venerable turbocharged 2.0-liter I4. No matter which engine setup you choose, all configurations will come with quattro and the ZF-sourced eight-speed Tiptronic transmission.

Below is a breakdown of the 2013 Q5 models and their pricing (excluding the $895 destination charge):

* 2.0 TFSI Premium: $35,900
* 2.0 TFSI Premium Plus: $40,200
* 2.0 TFSI hybrid Prestige: $50,900
* 3.0 TFSI Premium Plus: $43,900
* 3.0 TFSI Prestige: $51,400

The MMI navigation plus package is included with the Prestige trim and is available as a $3,550 option for the Premium Plus trim. For those that choose the Q5 2.0 TFSI hybrid, you may want to consider choosing either the 19" five double-spoke Offroad design wheels as a no-cost upgrade or the impressive 20" 10-spoke Turbine design wheels for an extra $800 over the standard 19" 10-spoke Turbine design wheels.

If I were to build a Q5 the way that I would like it, I would start with the Q5 3.0 TFSI Premium Plus, add the S Line package, sport interior, MMI navigation plus, Aluminium Dimension inlays and dressed in Scuba Blue. The price is about the same as the 2.0 TFSI hybrid Prestige's base price at $50,790 without the $895 destination charge.

Yes... I have a slight fetish for Audi blues and no, I don't need help with that.
