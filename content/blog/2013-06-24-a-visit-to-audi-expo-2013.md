This past Saturday, I made the trek back up to [Griot's Garage](http://www.griotsgarage.com/) in Tacoma, Washington (for the second time in as many years) to join the fun at [Audi Expo](http://www.audiexpo.com/). Unlike last year, I was able to arrive early to get a nice parking spot and stayed until after the raffle and best car at the show was announced.

Although the variety of Audis on display was as varied as last year, but it seemed that actual attendance wasn't quite as strong. Last year, there were quite a few cars parked out in front and on the grass, and with most of the spots taken up by Audi vehicles. This year, the grass lot was only occupied by vendors and the bounce castle. Interestingly, there was only one Audi R8 on display, and that was one done up in Suzuka Gray matte wrap by [NorthWest Auto Salon](http://www.northwestautosalon.com/) and no TT RS on the lot; versus last year, where there were at least one TT RS and four R8s.

Even without as many Audis on display, a good time was had at Audi Expo. I made use of the 15% discount at Griot's to pick up some much needed Spray On Car Wash and leather cleaner/conditioner.

Josh Decker of [Quattroworld](http://quattroworld.com/) brought his B5 RS 4 Avant and Quattroworld's [#ProjectAllroad](http://tagboard.com/ProjectAllroad).

Also at Audi Expo was a Solar Orange TTS and a Solar Orange RS 5.

Food for the event was provided by the [BUNS food truck](http://www.bunsonwheels.com/index.html), which served some really good burgers and fries. I opted for The Big Robby (sans onions) and a serving of truffle fries and was not disappointed.

In between taking photos of Audis and chatting with several owners, I stopped to chat with Chris Kirk of [Sameday](http://www.sameday-usa.com/)</a> and Josh Decker. I also had a nice chat with Ben Moses, formerly of [Achtuning](http://achtuning.com/) and now at [University Audi](http://www.universityaudi.com/index.htm).

Towards the end of the event was the raffle and door prizes for those that were still present, as well as for the best car of the show, which ended up with a tie and the winner chosen by best two-out-of-three coin toss.

I didn't walk away empty handed, as my name was drawn as a winner of an Audi weatherproof jacket. Since it was a ladies's jacket, I gave the jacket to my mother when I got home.

Along with raffle and door prizes, there were several time in which 5-6 grab bags were laid out for people to dash out and grab.

The prizes were all made possible by various vendors that had sponsored and had displays at Audi Expo, including: NorthWest Auto Salon, [Larson Audi of Tacoma](http://www.larsonaudioftacoma.com/), University Audi, [Accutint](http://accutint.com/), Sameday and Achtuning.

I am looking forward to going back up to Audi Expo next year.
