The Audi USA website has been updated with both the model pages and online configurators for the facelifted 2013 A5 and S5 cabriolets. You can find likes to the respective pages below.

* [2013 S5 Cabriolet](http://models.audiusa.com/s5-cabriolet) ([online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=S5-C-2013))
* [2013 A5 Cabriolet](http://models.audiusa.com/a5-cabriolet) ([online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=A5-C-2013))

The model page and the online configurator for the 2013 RS 5 coup√© is still missing in action.

The 2013 A5 Cabriolet that I would build to cruise around in would start with the Prestige trim, Scuba Blue, Black seats, base 18-inch V-design wheels and the Sport package. This cabrio would come in at $57,020 list.

If I had my way with a 2013 S5 cabriolet, it would be in Prestige trim with Estoril Blue Crystal paint, Black and Lunar Silver seats (two-tone seats FTW), base 18-inch wheels, quattro with Sports Rear Differential and Carbon Atlas inlays. The hit to my wallet would be around $69,670 list.
