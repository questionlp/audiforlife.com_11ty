Calling all Audi enthusiasts in the Portland metro area to come out and visit the [Cars in the Park](http://specialexhibitions.portlandartmuseum.org/allure/events/carsinthepark93/) and the [Allure of the Automobile](http://specialexhibitions.portlandartmuseum.org/allure/) events on 3 September 2011 from 10:00 to 15:00. There will be several Audi cars represented as part of the "2 Seaters at the Meters", including my 2011 S5. The Cars in the Park event is free for all visitors, but tickets are required to visit the Allure of the Automobile exhibition. The exhibition is at the Portland Art Museum while the Cars in the Park will be held in the Park Blocks.

The weather should be great for both events, granted that the meteorologists are correct, and so should the cars on display. Hope to see you there!
