It was the afternoon before Christmas and left work early, I headed down to [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) to take care of a few things. I had brought my camera bag with me (which had my Nikon D800E, AF-S 16-35mm f/4 VR, AF-S 70-200mm f/2.8 VR II and a Sigma 35mm f/1.4 Art) in the slim chance that there was something unique down there.

Well, my hunch was right and I had found out that they had a matte Daytona Gray Audi RS 7 parked in the back.
