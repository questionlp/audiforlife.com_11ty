Update: I have posted up two new versions of the wallpaper for those running MacBook Air or similar laptops with either 1366x768 or 1440x900 screen resolutions.

On 30 March 2012, I went to an A4 allroad quattro event held at [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) with a Leica M9 and a Summicron-M 50mm f/2 in hand. I was there to admire the various Audi vehicles that were on display, to mingle about and to take pictures.

I made use of both the showroom ground floor and the upper level to take various pictures of the two Euro-spec A4 allroad quattro vehicles on display. There were several other great Audi vehicles on display in the service drive, service bay and parked outside.

After the event, I spent a fair amount of time pouring through all of the files and putting them through my usual workflow. There was [one picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/7445351934/) that stood out as my absolute favorite among many other favorite pictures taken with my Leica. After posting it on several sites ([including Flickr](www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157630292329070/)), I have finally gotten a chance to go back and make desktop wallpapers from that picture.

I have nipped and tucked the desktop wallpapers to make them perfectly sized for five common widescreen resolutions. For screens with an aspect ratio of 16:10, I have made three versions available: 1440x900, 1680x1050 and 1920x1200. For the more common screens with an aspect ratio of 16:9, I have created two versions: 1366x768 and 1920x1080. Just right-click on the version that you want to download and select "Save Link As...".

I have opted to pass on creating a version for non-widescreen displays as that would have altered the framing too much.

My thanks go out to Audi Wilsonville and [Scott Mitchell](http://iamaudi.com/) for allowing me to roam around and take pictures.
