A few days ago, I caught wind of a (bespoken) Daytona Gray Audi RS 7 that had arrived at [Sunset Audi (now Audi Beaverton)](http://www.audibeaverton.com/) waiting for its owner. Last night, after work, I had the chance to stop by and take a couple of photos of the RS 7. I was also treated with the sound of the RS 7 starting up and it revving while parked in the delivery area.

The RS 7 was dressed well both inside and out with 21-inch Titanium finished wheels, black Valcona leather with contrast honeycomb stitching and the (very dapper) layered aluminium/black wood inlays.

The photos were taken with a pretty new Nikon D800E and a not-quite-so-new 24mm f/3.5 PC-E tilt/shift manual focus lens. Since the sun was setting at that time, I had to bump up the ISO and all of the shots were without any support mechanisms (no tripod, monopod or other stabilizing equipment). That being said, the photos didn'tÂ _quite_ turn out as well as I would have wanted.

I would like to thank Shane Randall and Ty Davis at [Sunset Audi (now Audi Beaverton)](http://www.audibeaverton.com/) for pinging me about the RS 7 and giving me a chance to take photos of the car.
