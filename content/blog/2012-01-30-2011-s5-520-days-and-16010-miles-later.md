I can't believe it has been just over 520 days since I picked up my 2011 Audi S5 and the odometer ticked past 16,000 miles yesterday afternoon. Unfortunately, I didn't catch it when it went past the mark... but was able to take a picture of the odometer this morning.

Feel free to ignore the average fuel economy, as it usually doesn't go that low... well, frequently anyway ;)

Even after having the S5 for 520 days, I am still in love with the way it looks (Sprint Blue and two-tone seats FTW) and it is a great daily driver. The seats are still extremely comfortable and just melt away all of the pent up stress when I get into the car after a long day's work. If the seats weren't enough, the sound of the 4.2-liter engine and joy of driving the S5 is just like a hot knife through cultured butter.
