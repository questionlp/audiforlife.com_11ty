Buzz surrounding my Audi S5 and the [#LoveMyS5](https://twitter.com/search/#LoveMyS5) hashtag has increased in the past weeks with Edmunds [InsideLine.com](http://insideline.com/) publishing my [#LoveMyS5 story](https://web.archive.org/web/20120316182939/blogs.insideline.com/readersrides/2012/03/linhs-2011-audi-s5-coupe.html) ([local archive](/lovemys5)). Trying to find a way to continue to spread my love for the S5, I found out that [LoveMyS5.com](/lovemys5) was available and I decided to snatch it up.

After a couple of hours of manually manipulating HTML and CSS, I was able to launch the site pretty darn quickly. As with my #LoveMyS5, the site will be evolving over time with galleries, videos, etc.
