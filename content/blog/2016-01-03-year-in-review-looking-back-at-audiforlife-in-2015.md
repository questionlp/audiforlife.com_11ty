Compared to the [action packed year that was 2014](/2015/01/year-in-review-looking-back-at-audiforlife-in-2014/), this past year has been a bit quieter in the Audi For Life front due to work and other projects taking over any spare time that I would have had for photography and excursions in various Audis.

Having said that, I was able to go out and cover several key events in the Pacific Northwest, including [Audi Expo](/2015/07/in-photos-audi-expo-2015/) up in Tacoma, Washington, [Quattrofest](/2015/11/in-photos-quattrofest-2015/) at Portland International Raceway and the [grand opening event for Audi Beaverton's new terminal building](/2015/09/audi-beaverton-grand-opening-event-from-behind-the-lens/).

## Audi Expo 2015

A few days before the [Audi Beaverton](http://www.audibeaverton.com/) grand opening event, I had an opportunity to do a [quick photo shoot of the new 2017 Audi R8 V10 plus](/2015/09/in-photos-dynamite-red-2017-audi-r8-v10-plus/) that was to be unveiled at the event.

Of course, the new 2017 Audi R8 V10 plus was not the only Audi R8 that I was able to do a quick photo shoot of in 2015. Back in May 2015, [Audi wilsonville had a Mythos Black Audi R8 competition](/2015/05/in-photos-mythos-black-audi-r8-competition-at-audi-wilsonville/) that I snapped a few photos of.

In September, I caught wind that there was an [Audi exclusive Riviera Blue S6 that was available at Audi Wilsonville](/2015/09/in-photos-exclusive-riviera-blue-audi-s6/) and they give me as much time as I wanted to take photos of the gorgeous S6.

Back on August 27, 2015 marked the [fifth anniversary of having my Sprint Blue Audi S5](/2015/08/five-years-of-lovemys5/).

To round out 2015, I was check out a [new 2017 Audi Q7](https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-q7) that was making its rounds to different Audi dealers, in this case, it was visiting [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/). I snuck out from work at lunch and got to [take a few photos and learned of some of the new MMI and new technology available](/2015/12/in-photos-and-quick-impressions-the-new-2017-audi-q7/).

I am really looking forward to what 2016 will bring, including the arrival of the new Audi R8 and the new A4 sedan. Have a Happy Four Ringed New Year!
