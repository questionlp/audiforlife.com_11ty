This morning, I arrived at the place that [PDX C&C](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/) gathers each Saturday morning a bit early and decided to take the opportunity to take several photos of my 2011 S5. There was just about the right amount of sun peering through the trees, as well as providing a good amount of shady areas.

All of the photos were taken with my Leica M9 and a Voigtl√§nder Ultron 28mm f/2 lens, stopped down to f/5.6 and at ISO 160. No filters were used or harmed during the photo shoot.
