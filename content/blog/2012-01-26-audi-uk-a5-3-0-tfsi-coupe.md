Hmm... it looks like you can, at least in the UK, build an A5 coupé with a 3.0 TFSI engine. Granted, the engine is detuned (272 PS versus 333 PS in the S5, 400 Nm versus 440 Nm) and rated about 0.9s slower in the 0-100kmh. Even more interesting is that the A5 3.0 TFSI is about 2000 quid less than the S5.

I know the same trick is done with the petrol version of the Q7 here in the states. I'm wondering if we'll see this spread to more models and here in the US.
