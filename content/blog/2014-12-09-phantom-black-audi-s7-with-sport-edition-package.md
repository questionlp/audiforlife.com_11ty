On Friday, I saw a photo that [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) had posted on Twitter [showing off an exclusive Audi S7](https://twitter.com/AudiWilsonville/status/540986979194634240). I had to head down there Saturday morning, before heading into work, knowing that I probably wouldn't get another chance to see it in person. Turned out that I was right, but more on that later.

Although the S7 did not have an Audi Exclusive paint option and you probably couldn't tell what made that S7 exclusive with just a glance from outside. Looking into the S7, you will start to notice the red contrasting diamond stitching on the seats, the Crimson Red seat belts, the matching red leather door panel inlays and on the center console.

All of that, in addition to the exclusive floor mats are part of the "S7 Sport edition" package that adds $10,415.00 to the sticker price. That package, along with the Black Optic, Driver Assistance and Cold Weather packages and a few other options, brought the sticker price of the Phantom Black S7 just north of the $100,000 price point.

Unfortunately for those that wanted to check out the exclusive S7, it was sold on Monday afternoon and headed to its new home.

Additional photos of the exclusive Audi S7, along with other photos from that morning, [have been posted on to Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157649647603661/). I would like to thank [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) for letting me roam about and take photos not too soon after they opened for the day.
