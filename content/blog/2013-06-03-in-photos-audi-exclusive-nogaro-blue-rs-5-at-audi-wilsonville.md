I had the opportunity to do a photo shoot of a bespoken Audi Exclusive Nogaro Blue RS 5 that had arrived at Audi Wilsonville. A friend of mine also came down to check out the Exclusive beast and size it up against his Ibis White TT RS.

Nogaro Blue had been, and continues to be, a very popular color on the original RS 2 Avant and even more popular on the B5 line. Sprint Blue eventually replaced Nogaro Blue and became the predominant blue for the B7 era. I included my Sprint Blue S5 in some of the photos to show a contrast between the two colors.
