The online configurators for the facelifted A5 and the S5 coupés are now up and running on the Audi of America website. You'll find the links to the new model pages and the online configurators below. The 2013 S5 coupé finally gets the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 and the dual-clutch S-Tronic gearbox that has been an option on the S4 sedan and the sole gearbox for the S5 cabriolet.

For additional information about the 2013 A5 and S5 coupés, please refer to my "[Analysis of the 2013 Model Year Pricing: Part 1](/2012/05/analysis-of-2013-model-year-pricing-part-1/)" blog post.

If I were to configure a 2013 S5, it would have to be in Estoril Blue Crystal with Black/Silver Alcantara:
