Audi of America has posted up both the 2013 A3 [product page](http://models.audiusa.com/a3) and the [online configurator](http://configurator.audiusa.com/acc/aoa.do?cid=A3-SB-2013) on AudiUSA.com. The 2013 A3 is a carry over from 2012 with a few minor tweaks and a slight price bump from last year.

The base 2013 A3 2.0T FWD starts at $27,270 with a manual and $28,750 with an S Tronic gearbox, and add $2,000 if you want to bump up to Premium Plus. For a 2013 A3 2.0T quattro with S Tronic in Premium trim starts at $30,850 and the Premium Plus trim starts at $32,850.

If you want a TDI clean diesel version of the 2013 A3 2.0 TDI FWD with S Tronic, Premium and Premium Plus trims start at $30,250 and $32,250 respectively.

Building up a 2013 A3 2.0 TDI Premium Plus in Scuba Blue with most options, including the Titanium Package, MMI navigation and black roof rails cranks the price up to $39,030 including the $895 destination charges.
