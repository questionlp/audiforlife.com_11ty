My name is Linh and I must confess, I am an Audi enthusiast.

Now that I've gotten that off of my chest, I am starting this blog to chronicle the history and continuing developments of my two Audis: a 2011 S5 coup√© and a 2004 A4 sedan. I will also cover some of the news from the Audi community and exciting new vehicles and Audi-related products.

Look forward to some articles on the first anniversary for my S5 in the coming weeks.
