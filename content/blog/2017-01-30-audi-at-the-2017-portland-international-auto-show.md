The [2017 Portland International Auto Show](http://portlandautoshow.com/), held at the [Oregon Convention Center](https://www.oregoncc.org/), had all of the major brands and marques on display. I took a hiatus from going to the show the last couple of years and decided that I had to go after hearing about several models (including a couple of non-Audi ones) that will be on display. For Audi, there were three, soon to arrive in the US, models that were on display: the [2018 Audi A5 coupé](https://www.audiusa.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2016/11/all-new-2018-audi-a5-and-s5-models-boast-sharpened-design-and-en), the [2018 Audi Q5](https://www.audiusa.com/newsroom/press-kits/2018/2018-q5-sq5) and the [2017 Audi R8 V10 Spyder](https://www.audiusa.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2017/01/audi-of-america-all-new-2017-r8-v10-spyder).

In addition to the three new models on display, almost entire Audi family of models were proudly on display. Although the S3 and the S8 plus represented the S model line, there was an RS 7 to represent the only RS model currently on sale in the US.

There was also an Audi R8 V10 plus dressed in Ara Blue Crystal Effect that greeted people as they entered the south Luxury Loft.

Representatives from [Audi Beaverton](http://www.audibeaverton.com/) and [Audi Wilsonville](http://www.audiwilsonville.com/) were there to answer everyone's questions and to help show off the trio of new models. One thing that made me smile was that BMW's display at the same south Luxury Loft was basically in the back of the room, behind both Audi and Volvo. Don't worry, I won't be posting photos of any blue and white roundels here.
