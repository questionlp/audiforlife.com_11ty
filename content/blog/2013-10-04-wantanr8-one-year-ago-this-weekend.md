One year ago this weekend, Saturday, October 6th, 2012, my dreams and wishes came true. It was the day that I got the keys to an Audi R8 V10 for 36 hours as my prize for being chosen one of eight #WantAnR8 winners for 2012. Between filming and several blitzes to the coast, mountains and around the Willamette Valley, my time in the R8 flew by in a snap; and, so has the time since my #WantAnR8 weekend.

After my whirlwind with R8, I posted up four blog posts documenting my weekend. Those four posts are:

* [#WantAnR8 Experience Part One: Winning](/2012/10/wantanr8-experience-part-one-winning/)
* [#WantAnR8 Experience Part Two: The Big Day](/2012/10/wantanr8-experience-part-two-the-big-day/)
* [#WantAnR8 Experience Part Three: Nightfall and Meeting Mt. St. Helens](/2012/10/wantanr8-experience-nightfall-and-meeting-mt-st-helens/)
* [#WantAnR8 Experience Part Four: The Farewell and Final Thoughts](/2012/10/wantanr8-experience-part-four-the-farewell-and-final-thoughts/)

Since then, Audi USA has posted up my #WantAnR8 video, using clips that the film crew captured that morning.

I also tried to capture some of the weekend with a GoPro, but only one clip survived.

I am still very grateful for the #WantAnR8 experience and want to thank Audi and the social media team at that time for the opportunity! I also want to thank Julie McCoy for starting the #WantAnR8 hashtag and campaign.
