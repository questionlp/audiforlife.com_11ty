As I mentioned in my [previous blog post](/2012/08/going-on-a-spirited-drive-after-pdx-cc/), I spent a good portion of my morning at [PDX C&C](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/). The weather was a bit gray earlier in the morning, but the clouds moved off and the sun started through. Although I had brought my Leica M9 with both a Voigtländer Color Skopar 21mm f/4 and a NOKTON Classic 35mm f/1,4 MC, I decided to only shoot with the Skopar 21mm and do a bit of experimenting.

Along with the oodles of Porsche 911s and the usual set of Ferraris, there were three really nice surprises. First, an artist came with his collection of watercolors and silkscreens for display and for sale. The art focused on classic and modern racing and race cars, focusing around Porsches and LeMans cars. The second was the amazingly intricately build and detailed blue Daytona coupé replica.

The third surprise was a red Audi TT RS with black and red-accented wheels, carbon fibre side mirrors and fixed spoiler. The owner of the red TT RS had just picked it up a week ago and is really enjoying it.
