The odometer for my 2011 S5 coup√© ticked past the 20,000 mile mark while driving up to Audi Expo yesterday. Other than some traffic getting into downtown Seattle for a late lunch and on the way back down to Tacoma, the S5 was nice and smooth and the seats provided the right amount of grip and comfort.

I will post up pictures later in the day or tomorrow night.
