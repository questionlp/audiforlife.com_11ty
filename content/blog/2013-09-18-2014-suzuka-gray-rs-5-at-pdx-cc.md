A friend of mine just got his new 2014 Suzuka Gray RS 5 coup√©, which he ordered several months ago, and stopped by PDX C&C with it on Saturday. The RS 5 is fairly well equipped with MMI navigation plus, Titanium Package and Sports exhaust system. Eventually, the RS 5 will adopt even more of a Stormtrooper look with wrapped side mirrors, suspension, spacers and an aftermarket exhaust setup.

Below are some of the photos that were taken with a Sony RX100 and massaged with Lightroom.
