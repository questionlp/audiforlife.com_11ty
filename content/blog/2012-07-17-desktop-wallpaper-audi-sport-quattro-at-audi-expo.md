Among the [dozens upon dozens of amazing cars](http://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157630485220094/) that came out to Audi Expo on 7 July 2012, one of the special cars on display is a fully decked out [Sport Quattro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/7530565958/). As it is an amazing sight to behold, I have created desktop wallpaper from one of the photos that I took of the legendary beast.

The desktop wallpaper is available in three sizes: 1440x900, 1680x1050 and 1920x1200. To download the respective wallpaper, just right-click on the one that you want below and choose "Save Link As...".

The original photo was taken with a Leica M9 and a Voigtl√§nder NOKTON Classic MC 35mm f/1,4.
