Every year for the past 15 years, you know Summer is arriving when Audi Expo kicks off, and this year was no exception. Audi Expo 2015, held at [Griot's Garage Flagship Retail Store and Event Center](http://www.griotsgarage.com/) on June 20th, brought together a large variety of Audis and owners to check out each other's vehicles, and to soak in some sun and tunes mixed by [DJ Alex Djnug Ng](https://www.facebook.com/DJNug).

For those that were hungry and thirsty for more than just cars and car talk, [BUNS on Wheels](http://www.bunsonwheels.com/) grilled up some amazing burgers and truffle fries. In addition to burgers and fries, [Ram International Catering](http://www.raminternationalcatering.com/) set up a beer garden and served up beer and wine.

The event wrapped up with the raffling off of door prizes and the presentation of the Best in Show award. The Best in Show award is handed out to the Audi that garnered the most votes cast by those attending Audi Expo. For 2015, the winner of the Best in Show award was DJ Alex Djnug Ng for his wonderfully, kitted-out B7 Audi A4.
