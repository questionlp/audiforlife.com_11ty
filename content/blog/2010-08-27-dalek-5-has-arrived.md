A couple of months ago, I placed an order for an item that I gave a codename of "Dalek-5". Until this post, I have not mentioned what this item is. What is this "Dalek-5"? Well, it is a 2011 Audi S5. Being a big Doctor Who fan, I decided to christen my new car, Dalek, and the five represents the numeral in the model.

The new car arrived at the dealer a little while ago and I took some pictures when I get to see it for the first time. Today, it has finally come home with me. Over the next several days, I will try to tame the beast, rather the clutch.

Pictures of the new car is posted up on my [Picasa gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/questionlp/2011AudiS5#). Have a look see.
