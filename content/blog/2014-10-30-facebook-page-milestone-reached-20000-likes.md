Back on 11 August 2011, I made my first major Audi-related foray into social media by creating the <del>Audi For Life Facebook Page</del>. It started as a humble page reflecting my love of everything Audi.Â There were several rough spots and hiccups that happened as the page hit its teething and admin pains; but, the page survived and continued to grow organically.

I was thrilled to see the page hit a pretty huge milestone yesterday: 20,000 page likes!

I want to thank all of the fans and the Audi community for making this happen and I'm looking forward to the next milestones: 50,000 Likes and 10,000 followers on <del>Twitter</del>!
