I would like to announce that [Audi Club Northwest](http://audiclubnw.org/) will be holding a holiday party and holiday lights drive in Portland, Oregon on December 8th. This event coincides with the annual holiday event that the club is hosting up in the Seattle, Washington area that same night.

The holiday party kicks off at 4:00 PM at the [Janzten Beach Bar & Grill - Red Lion Hotel on the River](https://plus.google.com/116202243430446488825/about?gl=us&hl=en). Afterwards, the group will meet up at 6:15 PM with the Portland chapter of the Mercedes-Benz Club of America to do the Winter Wonderland Holiday Lights Drive at Portland International Raceway.
