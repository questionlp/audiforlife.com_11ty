Next Saturday, 25 February 2012, [Portland Cars & Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/) will have a screening of Audi and NFL Films's "[Truth in 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_in_24)", a documentary in Audi's efforts preparing for the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The screening will be held at the Intel Hawthrone Farm campus, in the HF3 auditorium at 09:30. The address is: [5200 NE Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124](http://g.co/maps/gddhs).

Some of the group will be meeting up at the normal location, behind the [Starbucks off of Sequoia Parkway](http://g.co/maps/jns27) in Tigard at 08:00. You can stop by, grab coffee and/or breakfast and join the caravan to HF3. After the meeting, you can also join us for lunch at the McMenamins Imbrie Hall off of Cournelis Pass.

Since "Truth in 24" is the movie being screened, it is important that we have as many Audis represented as possible.

If you would like to join in, please make sure to [RSVP via the event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/348754928497751/) on Facebook.

As always, you can join the [Portland Cars & Coffee Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/) for information on regular meet ups and special events like this.
