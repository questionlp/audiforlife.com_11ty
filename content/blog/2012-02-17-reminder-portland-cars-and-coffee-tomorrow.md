Just a reminder to all gear/petrolheads in the Portland metro area that Portland Cars & Coffee will be meeting up tomorrow at 08:00, rain or shine.

Rumour is that [503 Motorsports](http://www.503motoring.com/) will bring out several surprises. As usual, any and all Audi and Volkswagen presence is greatly appreciated!
