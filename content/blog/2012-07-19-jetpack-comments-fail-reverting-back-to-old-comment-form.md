I just found out about a lovely issue with the WordPress Jetpack Comments plugin in which any comments submitted to the site go into the Ether. Unfortunately, I didn't find out about it until this evening when testing something else. For those that have tried to post comments to blog posts, I apologize for the problem and frustration.

The issue was due to a conflict between the Jetpack plugin and the CAPTCHA plugin that I use to reduce spam. I have fixed the issue and submitting comments now work.

Sigh...
