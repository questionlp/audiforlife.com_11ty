The following snippet is from the [press release](http://audiusanews.com/pressrelease/2791/1/audi-ted2012-announces-u.s-introduction-a3-e-tron) provided by Audi USA News.

> Audi today announced the battery-electric Audi A3 e-tron pilot program in the U.S. to define a progressive e-mobility driver experience for premium car buyers. Audi made the announcement of the engineering-based pilot program for the A3 e-tron today at TED2012 in Long Beach, Calif., where Audi is presenting a vision for the role transportation will play in the world's increasingly congested urban centers of the future.
>
> The A3 e-tron pilot program marks the first step by Audi into the expanding U.S. electric vehicle landscape, which is a central component of the discussion expected at the Audi Social Space at TED2012.
>
> At TED2012, Audi intends to spark a progressive dialogue about the role transportation will play in the global megacities of the future. The Audi Social Space will present a variety of perspectives on this topic on touch-screen video installations allowing attendees to pose new mobility scenarios for future urban spaces and contribute in real time to Audi's live Twitter feed through the #AudiTED hashtag.

The A3 e-tron pilot program will kick off in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Denver areas. The A3 e-tron is fully electric and is powered with a 26kw Li-Ion battery pack and can provide a range of approximately 90 miles, with a top speed of 90 MPH. The Li-Ion battery pack will not but into the interior space of the A3 and therefore will retain the same level of comfort and versatility.

Below are a selection of images of the A3 e-tron vehicle made available by Audi USA.
