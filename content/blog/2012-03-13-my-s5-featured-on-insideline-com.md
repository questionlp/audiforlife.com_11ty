I have been reading the blogs on [Edmunds](http://www.edmunds.com/) [InsideLine.com](http://www.insideline.com/) for several years now and started following their long-term test of a [2009 Audi S5](http://blogs.insideline.com/roadtests/PastVehicles/2009-audi-s5/). Fast forward to around a year ago when they started soliciting readers to submit quick write ups on reader's cars. Recently, those that are selected for publishing have been posted on a new [Reader's Rides](http://blogs.insideline.com/readersrides/) blog.

On 20 February 2012, I decided to submit a simple write-up (along with some pictures that I've taken of my S5) of the journey from drooling over Audi's A5 and S5 launch materials, to how I came to choosing an S5 and to the point that I picked up the S5.

Yesterday, I got an e-mail from the Managing Editor saying that my submission will be posted this morning. Woke up, got to work and checked the blog; lo and behold, it was [published with the pictures](https://web.archive.org/web/20120316182939/blogs.insideline.com/readersrides/2012/03/linhs-2011-audi-s5-coupe.html) ([local archive](/lovemys5)) that I included in my submission. Sweet!

I hope you get a chance to read and enjoy it!
