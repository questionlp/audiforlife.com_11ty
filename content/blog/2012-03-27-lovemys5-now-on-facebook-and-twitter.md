On the heels of launching [#LoveMyS5.com](/lovemys5), I have now created a new Facebook Page called [#LoveMyS5](https://facebook.com/LoveMyS5) and a companion [@LoveMyS5](https://twitter.com/LoveMyS5) Twitter account. Both the new Facebook Page and Twitter account will focus on various news, pictures and reviews about the Audi S5; along with some mentions of both the Audi A5 and the RS5.

If you like, or even _love_, the Audi S5, please Like the [#LoveMyS5 page](https://facebook.com/LoveMyS5) and follow [@LoveMyS5](https://twitter.com/LoveMyS5).

Audi For Life will continue to be all about Audi and the other brands under the both the Volkswagen Group and Porsche AG.
