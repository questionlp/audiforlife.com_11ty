As you may or may not know, I was chosen as one of eight winners of Audi's #WantAnR8 Twitter contest and was treated with an Audi R8 V10 coup√© for a weekend. If you would like a bit more detail on the experience, I have posted four blog posts covering the 36 hours that I had with the R8.

Almost four months later, Audi finally released the video of them delivering the R8 while I was at [PDX C&C](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PDXCandC/) on the morning of 6 October 2012.

I cannot thank Audi enough for the experience of a lifetime. I also would like to thank the #SocialLords, [Paul Meyers](https://twitter.com/thepaulmeyers) and [Andy White](https://twitter.com/white), for being the face of Audi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/audi) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/audi). And last, but not least, [Julie McCoy](https://twitter.com/jmdc88) for being the creator and the Queen of #WantAnR8.
