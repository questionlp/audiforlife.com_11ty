As you may have read in my previous posts, as well as on Twitter and Facebook, I have come down pretty harsh on Audi when they released prices for the 2013 A4 allroad quattro for the US.

In the "[Updated: Analysis (and mini-rant) of the 2013 A4 allroad quattro pricing](/2012/04/analysis-and-mini-rant-of-the-2013-audi-a4-allroad-quattro-pricing/)" post, I compared the announced prices for the 2013 A4 allroad quattro against the prices of both the 2012 A4 Avant and the 2012 Q5 2.0 TFSI. The price differences noted in the post weren't exactly apples to apples as the 2013 Q5 would bring on a facelift and different price points.

Now that Audi of America has released prices for the 2013 Q5, let's take a new look at how good or bad the 2013 A4 allroad quattro prices are.

The only two models and trims that the two models have in common are the 2.0 TFSI Premium and Premium Plus. While the A4 allroad quattro has a Prestige trim, one would have to jump up to the costly Q5 2.0 TFSI hybrid to get the Prestige trim. Also, most of the options and packages that are common between the A4 allroad quattro and Q5 are priced similarly, if not identically.

The 2013 A4 allroad quattro Premium trim has a base price of $39,600 while the Q5 2.0 TFSI Premium has a base price of $35,900 (both without the $895 destination charge). That's a significant $3,700 price difference against the A4 allroad quattro. Moving up to the Premium Plus trim, the A4 allroad quattro rings in at $42,900 while the Q5 2.0 TFSI $40,200 (again, without the $895 destination charge); meaning the A4 allroad quattro is $2,700 more expensive.

Both the A4 allroad quattro and the Q5 2.0 TFSI come with roughly the same standard features, but there are a couple of differences. For instance, the Q5 comes standard with hill descent control, while the A4 allroad quattro does not have it listed even as an option. Also, the Q5 2.0 TFSI Premium includes three-zone automatic climate control as standard, but the A4 allroad quattro Premium does not (it is standard when you jump to the Premium Plus or Prestige trims). The Q5 2.0 TFSI includes LED taillights as standard equipment across the board, but it is optional for the A4 allroad quattro Premium.

Now, one way you can look at things is that the Q5 is marketed to be a half-tier higher than the former A4 Avant and the A4 allroad quattro, meaning that the Q5 would be slightly better equipped than any A4 when comparing base Premium trims. That makes sense with the three-zone automatic climate control, but shouldn't the A4 allroad quattro also include hill descent control?

If you follow the same train of thought, the Q5 includes LED taillights as standard, yet the A5 coup√© does not. One would think that the A5 ought to have it standard as well to closely match the same option tiering as the Q5.

In either case, the Q5 doesn't cost more than the A4 allroad quattro. In fact, it is the other way around. You would hope that the A4 allroad quattro would at least match the standard features as the Q5 at those prices. One can say that the higher price of the A4 allroad quattro can be costed out in the allroad-specific suspension and body cladding. The other piece of the puzzle could be the lower production and sales volume for the A4 allroad quattro compared to the successful Q5. Then, there is also the US market's aversion to all things Avant or wagon and lust for anything crossover or SUV. I would say that all of the above play significant parts in the pricing difference and product marketing.

Do I like that the A4 allroad quattro costs more than the Q5? Of course not. Will the higher cost of the A4 allroad quattro turn off potential customers? Yes, but not the hardcore allroad fans. Will the A4 allroad quattro be considered a sales success? That is to be determined.

All in all, the Q5 will continue to be a sales magnet for Audi and the A4 allroad quattro's killing of the standard A4 Avant along with its not-so-great price will most likely make it more of a niche product. As an Audi enthusiast, that disappoints me.
