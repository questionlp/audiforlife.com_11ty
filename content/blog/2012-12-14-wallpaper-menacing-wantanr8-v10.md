Ever since I posted a screenshot of my iPad lock screen with an photo of an Audi R8 V10's menacing face as a wallpaper, there has been quite a bit of buzz about it. After having a little bit of spare time, I have finally gone back and created wallpaper versions of that photo for download, including one made for iPad with Retina Display.
