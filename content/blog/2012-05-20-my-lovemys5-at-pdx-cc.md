PDX C&C had another great turn out yesterday morning with many Porsches, three #LoveMyS5, a blacked-out R8, a red Mercedes SLS AMG, four Dodge Vipers, a Daytona coup√©, among dozens of other great cars. I have [posted pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/sets/72157629807416074/) from yesterday up on Flickr.

One of the guys that came created a video sampling some of the great cars that came out. You can see my Sprint Blue baby in a couple of the shots. Starting at about the 10:50 mark, you'll see me heading out. Yep, the exhaust is still stock...
