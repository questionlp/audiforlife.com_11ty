A couple of days ago, while I was looking through various pictures of my #LoveMyS5, I ran across a picture that I took of it's radio and GPS antenna module and [shared it on Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/OIqSlPEa97/):

Although I had originally captioned the original photo on Picasa with:

> The S5 shark is swimming in its own reflection.

I didn't remember that when I posted a version of the photo on to Instagram. Well, Paul Meyers of M80 picked up on that it kind of looks like a shark and that it was a couple of days before Discovery's Shark Week. Paul had posted a comment that simply said "#SharkWeek".

Anyway, I moved on and continued along my merry way... that is, until tonight when the [following happened](https://twitter.com/Audi/status/235189134665338881):

Yep, Audi posted up my Instagram picture on [their Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/p/OSlAO1umCD/) and sent out a tweet about it. Let's just say that my phone and Tweetdeck app go all a flutter.

Thank you Audi!
