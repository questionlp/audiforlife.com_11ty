I can't believe tonight marks the two month anniversary for the [Audi For Life Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/audiforlife). It did take me a while to succumb to the Facebook siren song; but, the ability to reach and connect with additional Audi enthusiasts was too all to enticing.

With who knows how many status updates later, not to mention the 94 Likes, I now wonder why I waited so long! :)

I want to thank everyone who has visited, and Liked, the page!

Audi For Life is here to stay and I will continue to spread my love of all things Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche!

Now, let those four rings shine!
