One of the local Cars and Coffee-like meets, PDX C&C, happens every Saturday morning, rain or shine. Well, on 31 March 2012, the group was met with some liquid sunshine. While there were not too many cars, I still pulled out my camera (Leica M9 with a Summicron-M 50mm f/2) and took a couple of photos.

One of those photos included my 2011 Sprint Blue S5 coup√© taking a nice shower. Even without any post-processing, the photo turned out to be quite beautiful (if I may say so myself). I only had to touch it up a bit and cropped it to take out some of the shrubs right in front of where I was standing.

It has taken me a while, but I have finally made desktop wallpaper versions of that image. You can download the size that you want below.
